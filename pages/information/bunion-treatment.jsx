                    <p>
                        Bunions can affect anybodyâ€™s foot as a result of constant pressure on the joint of the big toe and
                        sometimes the small toe as well. Most of the time, it occurs due to faulty footwear worn by both
                        men and women in which the feet are confined and always under pressure. The base
                        of the big toe get enlarged or distorted, which may need to be corrected to get back to the original
                        shape and also walk around painlessly.

                            <p>You specialist will carry out an X-ray to examine what damagae has been done to the bone before
                                starting any treatments. Depending on the severity of the condition, your specialist will advise on a treatment plan. There are non-invasive and invasive bunion treatment options. It depends on your
                                condition as to what plan will be suggested.</p></div>

                            <p>Some of the non surgical treatments may include: </p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Changing shoes: Wearing spacious and comfortable shoes can aid discomfort and stop the bunion deformity deterioating.</li>
                                <li>Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB), Acetaminophen (Tylenol), and naproxen
                                    sodium (Aleve) can relieve the pain. Cortisone injections also help in the same way.</li>
                                <li>Padding: Bunion pads or cushions are available over the counter which can be very
                                    useful for both the pain and in providing support to the painful bone.</li>
                                <li>Shoe inserts: Splints or inserts/ custom orthotics can help to distribute the pressure evenly
                                    during movement. This reduces the inflammation and the pain in the foot. It can also prevents your
                                    bunion from getting worse.</li>
                                <li>Ice application: This can relieve swelling and soreness of the bunion.</li>

                    <p>Our bunion expert Mr. Kaser Nazir provides options for 4 main types of bunion treatment- minimally
                        invasive keyhole bunion surgery, Lapidus procedure, scarf and akin osteotomy, and tailorâ€™s bunion
                        correction. Minimally invasive Keyhole bunion correction can provide less pain and less amount of time to recover. In the Lapidus,
                        realignment of the bunion is carried out, this is particuarly recommended for patient's with hypermobility. The Lapidus fusion helps to Stabilise the midfoot and also
                        reduces the risk of recurrence. A scarf and akin osteotomy is performed on small to moderate deformities.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Kaser Nazir has been correcting bunions for over 21 years and is an expert in his field. He is covered by a majority of the insurance companies. Both
                        patients and the peers vouch for his bunion treatment options, with glowing reviews following previous Bunion surgeries carried out.</p>
