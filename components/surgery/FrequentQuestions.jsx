    question: "Are Bunions serious?",
    answer: `A Bunion can be very painful and can lead to a swollen big toe, the smaller toes can even start to overlap. 
    
    They are progressive, meaning that they will not get better if left alone and will get worse over time. 
    
    Poorly fitted narrow shoes or shoes with heels can exacerbate the symptoms and speed up the progression.`,
